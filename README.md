The official Note:
*****************
                 We can say that we are the first global digital platform and the first most popular project on the planet and the universe to have introduced for the first time the concept "Double to earn Double" or "Hold to earn More" in the Web2.0 and Web3.0 sector.

In the near future, Internet users will come to understand and deeply embrace this concept or mechanism.

In a world of economic transition and the emergence of Web3.0, the new mechanism that we call: "Double to earn Double" or "Hold to earn More" is a new way to redefine the global economy.
A modern world in full economic boom needs more than "5 Billion Holders of Digital assets" worldwide to succeed successfully. This is a great job for crypto projects. All of us need to work together to succeed in bringing together one day more than 5 billion individuals who hold digital assets. Something that is not easy, really it will be a great mission. This is why we say that together with the "Double to earn Double" or "Hold to earn More" mechanism, we could make this great mission possible, the mission of bringing together more than 5 billion individuals who hold digital assets. Through the association or synchronization of several crypto projects, Meme_coins or Nft projects, this mission could become possible. Through the innovation or initiation of several BRIGE or Digital_Inter_Brige projects, this could become possible. Through the "Learn to earn" features, this mission could become possible. The fact that one day humans will be able to start living on the planet Mars, this could make this mission possible. We still hope that by then in the near future, 5 billion individuals will hold digital assets and join us in the crypto sector. This is a great mission anyway. And as humanity will necessarily continue to evolve and develop, the fact that there will be revolutionary initiatives like the creation of small new planets, as humans will one day be able to initiate major projects for the creation of new small planets and to install or place them in space, in the solar system, and send some volunteer humans to go and live there, in small new planets designed by man, we estimate that this could necessarily allow more than 5 billion individuals to hold digital assets to facilitate inter galaxy transaction. And today the new concept or mechanism that we call "Double to earn Double" or "Hold to earn More" will easily open the way for individuals to hold and keep digital assets in the world of waves, in space and to use them at any time and anywhere in the universe. On our digital platform "FreeBank Coin", we will have several projects and features or options and some projects will sometimes go further, to the point of sometimes allowing billions of individuals to connect, communicate and sometimes share their ideas or opinions around finance or society. Sometimes, together with you, we will experiment with new features allowing Internet users to earn rewards on all the activities they will carry out on the "FreeBank Coin" platform. FreeBank_Coin is a digital and decentralized bank. FreeBank_Coin is at the same time an electronic currency for any universe and Galaxy. It is also at the same time a decentralized digital platform. FreeBank_Coin is also an online game and social network. FreeBank_Coin is also artificial intelligence.

FreeBank_Coin means FreeMoney and FreeMoney means FreeFinance. FreeFinance means FreeMan. FreeMan is a human being who feels free, and again a FreeMan is one who is in harmony with the law of the universe. The universe is the ecosystem, the universal ecosystem. And the universal ecosystem is universal love, and universal love is the pure omnipresent energy that directs the universe in a good direction. The right direction is the right orientation. And a human being must be free to turn towards the right orientation. Popularity comes after. And in our universe, the most popular among financial energies is Bitcoin, but this Bitcoin is not omnipresent because it is only for rich men. It is difficult to surround yourself with the energy of Bitcoin or difficult to hold even 1 Bitcoin from scratch. Bitcoin is not omnipresent. But the FreeBankCoin (EBANK) will be omnipresent. Everyone who wants to hold even 1 FreeBankCoin and manage it in their own way, it is possible. It is possible to earn 1 FreeBankCoin from zero and manage it in your own way. Life is a game and in this game, if you win, you will also win life. That is why in our universe, in our ecosystem there will be several games. Several games that will allow you to earn FreeBankCoin (EBANK) every day from zero. They will be multidimensional games, because we are in a universe that also has several dimensions and systems. The games of Life or the trials of the universe, that is what makes us grow, especially in spirit and experience. We are a FreeSociety, a FreeSociety where you will find a FreeBankCoin or FreeMoney and a FreeFinance used by the FreeMen. The FreeMen are the future giants of humanity and the universe. FreeMen will also have friends, and these friends are in the most popular movement in the financial world. It is the 'MEME' or 'MEMEcoin' movement. The FreeBankCoin is also a MemeCoin. The FreeBankCoin is an ecosystem of universal love. The Free Society.

With the FreeBankCoin, become financially free. Become the manager of an electronic bank. EBANK is not only for planet earth. EBANK is for the entire universe. Take advantage of holding EBANK in abundance before the elites and extraterrestrials can discover it. Because the FreeBankCoin, because EBANK is for the entire universe.
=> Our main goal is to establish the connection with the extraterrestrials. And with the electronic means, we can negotiate with them so that the EBANK is a universal currency and a universal currency of exchange between humans and extraterrestrials. In a short time, the planet Mars will be habitable by humans and we will negotiate with the inhabitants of the planet Mars so that the EBANK becomes the currency of exchange also for the planet Mars. We will prepare ourselves for this great adventure and process. We will prepare ourselves for this great work. Maybe we are already ready. We are ready. Really ready to negotiate and work. Let's work together. Unity is strength.
=> How much have you already earned? Because it's a lot. A lot more. And then it's almost free and open source. Free in the electronic universe. Almost free in the digital spaces of web3.0. The door is wide open to hold some. Because it's a lot. Maybe it might become rare for the 2050s or 2100s. How much have you already earned? Because it's a lot. A lot really. The number of EBANK is a lot really. Allowing any universe to hold it. It's for the entire universe:
=> 60,000,000,000,000 EBANK. It's a lot for the entire universe. It's a lot for universal love.

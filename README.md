FreeBank_Coin means FreeMoney and FreeMoney means FreeFinance. FreeFinance means FreeMan. FreeMan is a human being who feels free, and again a FreeMan is one who is in harmony with the law of the universe. The universe is the ecosystem, the universal ecosystem. And the universal ecosystem is universal love, and universal love is the pure omnipresent energy that directs the universe in a good direction. The right direction is the right orientation. And a human being must be free to turn towards the right orientation. Popularity comes after. And in our universe, the most popular among financial energies is Bitcoin, but this Bitcoin is not omnipresent because it is only for rich men. It is difficult to surround yourself with the energy of Bitcoin or difficult to hold even 1 Bitcoin from scratch. Bitcoin is not omnipresent. But the FreeBankCoin (EBANK) will be omnipresent. Everyone who wants to hold even 1 FreeBankCoin and manage it in their own way, it is possible. It is possible to earn 1 FreeBankCoin from zero and manage it in your own way. Life is a game and in this game, if you win, you will also win life. That is why in our universe, in our ecosystem there will be several games. Several games that will allow you to earn FreeBankCoin (EBANK) every day from zero. They will be multidimensional games, because we are in a universe that also has several dimensions and systems. The games of Life or the trials of the universe, that is what makes us grow, especially in spirit and experience. We are a FreeSociety, a FreeSociety where you will find a FreeBankCoin or FreeMoney and a FreeFinance used by the FreeMen. The FreeMen are the future giants of humanity and the universe. FreeMen will also have friends, and these friends are in the most popular movement in the financial world. It is the 'MEME' or 'MEMEcoin' movement. The FreeBankCoin is also a MemeCoin. The FreeBankCoin is an ecosystem of universal love. The Free Society.
